I made a few design choices the vary slightly from the assignment instructions I wanted to to note.

1. NavBar: As a intentional design choice, I justified the NavBar across the page.
2. Name/Profile: I have set the background color for this element in the CSS file.  As a intentional design choice, it is the same as the body background.
3. Resume Items: I have set the border for the resume items in the CSS file. As a intentional design choice, it is the same color as the body, except for when in a hover state where it changes to the navy blue color.
